# Giphy Search

## Introduction
This is a React Js web project using the Giphy API. Involves a webpage where you can search for gifs and if you like the gif and want to see
more like it the site refers you to the profile of the Giphy user who made the gif. You can also sort your search by content ratings. So, If you're ok with seeing R rated gifs then selecting r allows gifs of ratings g through r to pop up.

Since this object uses the Giphy API, to run it you need to create a <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">Giphy Developers account</a> and go to
the dashboard and create an app to generate a key for interacting with the API.

## Steps to run as developer
1. First, install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>
2. Clone this repository
3. Open terminal, navigate to the project folder that you have cloned.
4. Open project in an editor
5. Go to Giphy.jsx and replace all strings next to the api_key property with your own api_key generated on Giphy Developers.
6. Run the command `npm start` to start the web server on `localhost: 3000`
7. Go to your web browser and visit `localhost: 3000`
8. That's it! Now that you're running the application, any change you run in code will reflect on your browser automatically.
